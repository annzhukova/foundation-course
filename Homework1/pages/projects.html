Create another <section> to showcase your projects. Each project should be inside an <article> element, 
    with a title (using a heading tag like <h2>), a brief description, and, if possible, 
        a link to the live project or a GitHub repository. 

Consider including an image or screenshot of each project inside the <article>.

<a href="about.html">About me</a> |
<a href="projects.html">Projects</a> |
<a href="contact.html">Contact me</a>
