                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Hi, my name is Anna Zhukova. I live in Tallinn. I am a bachelor and a master of Applied Mathematics and Informatics. I studied Statistics, Algorithms, and different methods for creating and evaluating maths models.
                    </p>
                <p>My bachelor's degree thesis was about superconductivity in graphene nanochannel
                structures. I had studied eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of a particle in a complex chain and
                built a mathematical model for researching properties of superconductivity. I used Green's
                function and theory of zero radius potential for approximating resolving this task.</p>

                <p>I worked
                as a frontend engineer at Yandex in 2010-2012 years where I got a bit of experience working with user interfaces
                and usability.</p>
                <p>
                In 2012 I founded a startup <a href="#sportfolio">Sportfolio</a>. For
                me it was a great life learning and experience.
                </p>
                <p>During 2014-2024 I was on maternity leave.</p>
                <p>In March 2020 I took a course of Applied Data Science Specialization in Coursera.org. It was
                based on Python language and visualisation tools. I was finishing it when I was waiting for
                the birth of my child.</p>
                <p>In 2025 I started my HCI Master Program.</p>
                <p>My hobby are sport, travel, bicycle travel with family, ecology, baking printed gingerbread (<a href="http://maguslinn.com">http://maguslinn.com</a>), videography, blogging.</p>

                    <p>2011 - 2015</p>
                    <p>Sportfolio was providing a service to managers of sport events
                    to organize their competitions and for athletes to participate in them and to record their
                    achievements. We were the first to provide such a service in Russia.
                    The biggest contest for Sportfolio was the ERGO White nights marathon (annual marathon
                    in Saint Petersburg, Russia) in 2014. There were 6k participants from 40 countries and our service
                    helped a lot with preparing data and accepting payments as well as providing insurance
                    services via online registration form. About 50% participants had registered online, thus
                    saving time and money for both categories of our customers: organizers and athletes.

                    <p>My hobby is baking souvenir gingerbread with prints. There are different views and tastes of it from classic gingerbread to special almondbread with martzipan filling and unique berrybread with natural berries.</p>

                    <p>My family tradition is bicycle travelling. Since 2007 we went to many countries all around Europe and also we had a trip to Baikal lake in Russia in 2010. </p>
                    <p>Hope website will be very soon. I write about our travelling and life in <a href="https://t.me/velozhuki">my blog</a> and see some video from our trips: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBCRyEycnbu6VIhzuvvovLVrvF3ERQ1rb">Norway by car and bikes</a>, <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XN-SOLMseTs">Holland</a>.</p>
