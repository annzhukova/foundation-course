            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Anna Zhukova. I live in Tallinn. I am a bachelor and a master of Applied Mathematics and Informatics. I studied Statistics, Algorithms, and different methods for creating and evaluating maths models.
                </p>
            <p>My bachelor's degree thesis was about superconductivity in graphene nanochannel
                structures. I had studied eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of a particle in a complex chain and
                built a mathematical model for researching properties of superconductivity. I used Green's
                function and theory of zero radius potential for approximating resolving this task.</p>

                <p>I worked
                as a frontend engineer at Yandex in 2010-2012 years where I got a bit of experience working with user interfaces
                and usability.</p>
                <p>
                In 2012 I founded a startup Sportfolio. It was providing a service to managers of sport events
                to organize their competitions and for athletes to participate in them and to record their
                achievements. We were the first to provide such a service in Russia.
                The biggest contest for Sportfolio was the ERGO White nights marathon (annual marathon
                in Saint Petersburg, Russia) in 2014. There were 6k participants from 40 countries and our service
                helped a lot with preparing data and accepting payments as well as providing insurance
                services via online registration form. About 50% participants had registered online, thus
                saving time and money for both categories of our customers: organizers and athletes. For
                me Sportfolio was a great life learning and experience.
                </p>
                <p>During 2014-2024 I was on maternity leave.</p>
                <p>In March 2020 I took a course of Applied Data Science Specialization in Coursera.org. It was
                based on Python language and visualisation tools. I was finishing it when I was waiting for
                the birth of my child.</p>
                <p>In 2025 I started my HCI Master Program.</p>
                <p>My hobby are sport, travel, bicycle travel, ecology, baking printed gingerbread (<a href="http://maguslinn.com">http://maguslinn.com</a>), videography, blogging.</p>
